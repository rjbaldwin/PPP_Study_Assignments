	During the course of this text, I shall outline the aesthetic, creative and technical evolution of two compositions, entitled 'Flat Land'(FL), and 'Fright Of Life'(FOL) from my forthcoming collaborative album.  A critical reflection upon my involvement will be provided along the way, be that as it may, for an in-depth evaluation of each individual and their area of expertise, please refer to my paper entitled SOPs, from assignment submission 2.  The paper will conclude with an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the overall project, followed by any issues that will be rectified when submitting for the commercial market.  Technical details will only be evaluated if they are a significant factor in the recording.  For the sake of textual economy, details about microphone selection, instrument recording set-up description, and software usage will be covered in the appendices.  In most cases, standard dynamic processing and equalisation should be assumed unless otherwise stated.
