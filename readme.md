// These are some of the tasks I completed from the B Stroustrup Programming Principles and Practice using c++
// between August 2022 to Aug 2023.  With a newborn, as well as my full time job writing music for TV and lecturing in music, this was a
// tough book but rewarding read. 
// I did as many as i could with my knowledge at the time (this book was my intro to actually programming properly at the age of 39!).  
// I'll probably revisit these at some point as I have since written some proper software and have learnt more "on the job".
